typically have exactly ONE location, but this need not be the
case. Some features may not be localized (eg a gene that has been
characterized genetically but no sequence/molecular info is
available). NOTE ON MULTIPLE LOCATIONS: Each feature can have 0 or
more locations. Multiple locations do NOT indicate non-contiguous
locations (if a feature such as a transcript has a non-contiguous
location, then the subfeatures such as exons should always be
manifested). Instead, multiple featurelocs for a feature designate
alternate locations or grouped locations; for instance, a feature
designating a blast hit or hsp will have two locations, one on the
query feature, one on the subject feature.  features representing
sequence variation could have alternate locations instantiated on a
feature on the mutant strain.  the column:rank is used to
differentiate these different locations. Reflexive locations should
never be stored - this is for -proper- (ie non-self) locations only;

derivable extra locations for a feature. The default locgroup=0 is
used for the DIRECT location of a feature. !! MOST CHADO USERS MAY
NEVER USE featurelocs WITH logroup>0 !! Transitively derived locations
are indicated with locgroup>0. For example, the position of an exon on
a BAC and in global chromosome coordinates. This column is used to
differentiate these groupings of locations. the default locgroup 0
is used for the main/primary location, from which the others can be
derived via coordinate transformations. another example of redundant
locations is storing ORF coordinates relative to both transcript and
genome. redundant locations open the possibility of the database
getting into inconsistent states; this schema gives us the flexibility
of both warehouse instantiations with redundant locations (easier for
querying) and management instantiations with no redundant
locations. An example of using both locgroup and rank: imagine a
feature indicating a conserved region between the chromosomes of two
different species. we may want to keep redundant locations on both
contigs and chromosomes. we would thus have 4 locations for the single
conserved region feature - two distinct locgroups (contig level and
chromosome level) and two distinct ranks (for the two species)';

blast hits and HSPs) have two locations - one on the query and one on
the subject. Rank is used to differentiate these. Rank=0 is always
used for the query, Rank=1 for the subject. For multiple alignments,
assignment of rank is arbitrary. Rank is also used for
sequence_variant features, such as SNPs. Rank=0 indicates the wildtype
(or baseline) feature, Rank=1 indicates the mutant (or compared) feature';

(containing feature), and subject as child (contained feature or
subfeature) -- we include the relationship rank/order, because even
though most of the time we can order things implicitly by sequence
coordinates, we cant always do this - eg transpliced genes.  its also
useful for quickly getting implicit introns';

different contexts; for example "chromosome" in SO and GO. A name
should be unique within an ontology/cv. A name may exist twice in a
cv, in both obsolete and non-obsolete forms - these will be for
different cvterms with different OBO identifiers; so GO documentation
for more details on obsoletion. Note that occasionally multiple
obsolete terms with the same name will exist in the same cv. If this
is a possibility for the ontology under consideration (eg GO) then the
ID should be appended to the name to ensure uniqueness';
