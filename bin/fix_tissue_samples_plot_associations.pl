fix_tissue_samples_plot_associations.pl - a script to fix associations between tissue samples and plots, including plate wells

=head1 DESCRIPTION

perl bin/fix_tissue_samples_plot_associations.pl -H <host> -D <dbname> file.tsv

where file.tsv is a tab delimited file with the following two columns:

=over 16

=item tissue_sample 

for the tissue sample uniquename

=item plot_name

for the plot name to be associated with the tissue_sample

=back

Checks that the tissue_sample and plot are of the correct type and not already associated with each other.
Emits an error to STDERR and proceeds to the next entry if conditions are not met.
