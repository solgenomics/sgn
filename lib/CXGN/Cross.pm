CXGN::Cross - an object representing a Cross in the database

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    my $cross = CXGN::Cross->new( { schema => $schema, cross_stock_id => 37347 });

    my $cross_name = $cross->cross_name(); # get cross name
    my $female_parent = $cross->female_parent(); #name of female parent
    my $female_parent_id = $cross->female_parent_id(); # id of female parent
    my $male_parent   = $cross->male_parent(); # etc.
    my $progenies = $cross->progenies();
