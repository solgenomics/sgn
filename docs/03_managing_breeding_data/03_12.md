SGN databases provide an interactive design tool for creating breeding labels. To access the Label Desginer, click on “Label Designer” in the “Manage” menu.

To design a label, first select a data source.

![]({{"assets/gifs/gif2.gif" | relative_url }})

Then select a page size and label format. If you don't see your page or label size as an option then select 'Custom' and enter the dimensions in pixels.

![]({{"assets/gifs/gif3.gif" | relative_url }})

Once you've selected a data source, page format, and label size, scroll down and begin adding elements to your label. For example, to add a 2D Barcode encoding plot_name:

![]({{"assets/gifs/gif4.gif" | relative_url }})

To add text of the accession_name in a large bold font:

![]({{"assets/gifs/gif5.gif" | relative_url }})

To add a custom text field including plot_number:

![]({{"assets/gifs/gif6.gif" | relative_url }})

To add a custom number field:

![]({{"assets/gifs/gif7.gif" | relative_url }})

Once your design is finished you can modify additional settings, save your design for later use, or download labels:
