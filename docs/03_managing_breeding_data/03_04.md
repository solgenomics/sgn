Seedlots are different from Accessions in that they represent the physical seed being evaluated in an experiment. Seedlots have things like physical storage locations and seed quantities, which accessions do not. Click Manage and then Seed Lots to begin.

3.4.1 Add New Seedlot(s)
-----------------

To add a single new seedlot, click on "Add Seedlot". This will bring up the following dialog where you enter information about where the seedlot exists, what accession or cross in contained in it, and how many seeds there are. A seedlot must contain either an accession or a cross, and not both.

In the case where you have many seedlots to add to the database, you can upload an excel XLS file instead. Click "Upload Seedlots" to see the following dialog.

3.4.2 Seedlot Transactions
-----------------

Seedlots are capable of tracking where seeds came from, such as from crosses, and to where seeds go, such as to plots in the field. If you navigate to a seedlot detail page you will see the following.

On this page you see and can edit information regarding a single seedlot, such as its name and location. You will also see a table indicating all t he transactions that a seedlot has been involved in, such as if it was planted in a plot in the field. Transactions to field plots are created when adding or uploading a new trial or from a trial's detail page. Clicking on "Add New Transaction" let you add a transaction from between this seedlot and another seedlot. This kind of transaction is useful for representing if you have distributed seed to different locations.

3.4.3 Find Seedlots For a List of Accessions
-----------------

A convenient tool for searching available seedlots for a list of accessions is available in the list tool. First open up your list of accessions. For help opening a list of accessions please see the List section help. There is a button called "See Available Seedlots".

Once you click this, you will see the following table in a dialog.

3.4.4 Create a seedlot for an Accession or Cross
-----------------

Complementary to what we saw above for creating seedlots from the "Manage Seedlots" page, it is possible to create a new seedlot from an accession's detail page or from the cross detail page. On  the accession detail page, this is visible in the "Related Stocks" section as seen below. The cross detail page has an identical section. Notice the link for creating a new seedlot, which streamlines adding the seedlot.
