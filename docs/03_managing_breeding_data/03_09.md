3.9.1 Uploading Fieldbook Phenotypes

### Export Fieldbook Database File

The database upload of Fieldbook phenotype data relies on the "Database" format from the Fieldbook. Please make sure to export the "Database" format from the Fieldbook if you intend to upload the data using the Fieldbook Upload we describe below. If you prefer to use the "Table" format that the Fieldbook exports, you can modify this format to work with the Speadsheet Upload we describe below.

### Upload Fieldbook Database File

To upload a Field Book Phenotype file in a database format, click the “Upload Fieldbook” link

The “Upload Fieldbook” link on this page and “Upload” link on the “Field Book Tools” page open the same dialogue. Please follow instructions for uploading phenotypic files on [*"Using Field Book App"*]({{site.baseurl}}{% link 03_managing_breeding_data/03_06.md %}) page.

Clicking on "Create Phenotyping Spreadsheet" will bring up a dialog where you can indicate the trial(s) you are interested in and the trait list you are interested in. Clicking "Submit" will download the xls file onto your computer, where you can then fill in the phenotypes.

### Uploading Spreadsheet File

To ensure that the file has a correct format for uploading, click on the “Verify” button. This will check the contents of the file and also perform quality checks on the values in the file. These checks include checking the trait definition for categorical values, minimum and maximum values, and data type checking. It will also check if there are already values uploaded for the given observation units and traits. If there are, there is an option to overwrite the existing values with the new values in your file. If the file is valid, only then can you click "Store" to store the information in the database.
