SGN databases support the Android Field Book App for collecting phenotypic data in the field with tablet computers. The app is available here:

[*https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fieldbook.tracker*](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fieldbook.tracker)

-   The app can also be downloaded directly from the Google Play store. There is no charge for the app.

-   Field Book App requires two files for collecting data: Field layout file and trait file.

-   SGN databases can generate the field layout file and trait file, which can be downloaded onto your computer, then transferred to an Android tablet device.

A typical workflow
------------------

1. Creating a [*field layout file*](#creating-layout-files) based on the design of field trial

2. Creating a [*trait file*](#creating-trait-files) from the list of traits

3. Downloading the field layout file and trait file from the database to your computer

4. Downloading the field layout file and trait file to the tablet (where the Field Book App is installed)

5. Collecting phenotypes

6. Exporting phenotypes from Field Book App to your computer

7. [*Uploading the exported phenotype file*](#uploading-pheno-files) from your computer to the database

3.9.1 Creating Field Layout Files for the Field Book App {#creating-layout-files}
--------------------------------------------------------

There are two alternative methods for creating “Field Layout Files”.
