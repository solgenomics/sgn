# Managing Barcodes

SGN databases provide tools for generating barcodes for stock identification. To access “Barcode Tools” page, clicking on “Barcodes” in the “Manage” menu.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='95%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/images/image82.png')
```

“Barcode Tools” page provides four options for generating barcodes:

-   Single barcode

-   Multiple barcodes

-   Plot phenotyping barcodes

-   Trial barcodes

To generate single barcode, clicking on “Generate Barcode” link on the “Barcode Tools” page.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='95%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/images/image274.png')
```

In the “Generate Barcode” section, specify the name of the barcode, size of the barcode, then clicking on “Generate Barcode”

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='95%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/images/image245.png')
```

The database will generate a barcode for your stock. The barcode can be printed for your stock identification. It also appears on its corresponding stock page.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='95%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/images/image264.png')
```
