            <h4>Images Alone:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Select multiple images directly for upload.</li>
                <li>If the images being uploaded were taken using Fieldbook, they have EXIF data that contains the observationUnitName, traitname, and timestamp. They can be uploaded without needing to change the file name.</li>
                <li>If images were NOT taken using Fieldbook, image file names should consist of the observationUnitName, traitname, number, and timestamp, all joined by underscores (the default naming system used by Fieldbook App).</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <h4>Images with Barcodes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Upload multiple selected images that contain a barcode with a stock ID.</li>
                <li>There should only be one barcode in each image, and the associated stock must already exist in the database.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Images with Associated Phenotypes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The "Associated Images" format is useful for uploading a zipfile of images in association with phenotype values.</li>
                <li>The phenotype values should be included in a .xls or .xlsx spreadsheet with the following columns:</li>
                <br/><table class="table table-hover table-bordered table-condensed table-responsive" >
                    <thead></thead>

                            <td>observationUnitName</td>
                            <td>observationVariableName</td>
                            <td>value</td>
                            <td>timestamp</td>
                            <td>image_name</td>

                </table>
                <li>The values in the <b>image_name</b> column should should match the image filenames in the zipfile.</li>
