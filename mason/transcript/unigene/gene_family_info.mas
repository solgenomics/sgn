 gene_family.mas
 Mason component to show gene family data associated to an unigene

0.1

=cut 

=head1 SYNOPSIS 

<& '/transcript/unigene/gene_family_info.mas', unigene => $unigene &>

 where $unigene is CXGN::Transcript::Unigene object 

=cut 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

 Another piece of mason code get the unigene data (gene family info) from the database and show it 
 as table web_page; 
 This code was taken from unigene.pl (originally added by Chenwei, 08/2005, slightly refactored, Lukas 9/2007)
