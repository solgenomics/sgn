                                <p> Discarding a seedlot is different from deleting a seedlot.
                                <li>Deleting a seedlot permanently removes that seedlot and all associated transactions from database. Discarding a seedlot inactivates the seedlot, but information related to that seedlot is still kept in the database.</li>
                                <li>Amount/Weight of discarded seedlot is labeled as "DISCARDED".</li>
                                <li>Discarding a seedlot can be reversed with UNDO function, but deletion a seedlot cannot be undone.</li>
                                <li>Discarded seedlots still can be viewed in seedlot details pages and are searchable. However, links for adding new transaction, editing details and transaction are removed.</li>
                                <li>Discarded seedlots are excluded from dropdown list for adding new transactions.</li>
