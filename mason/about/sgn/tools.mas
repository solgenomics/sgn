<dt>ESTs</dt>
<dd>SGN houses EST collections for tomato, potato, pepper, eggplant and
petunia and corresponding unigene builds. EST sequence data and cDNA
clone resources greatly facilitate cloning strategies based on
sequence similarity, the study of syntenic relationships between
species in comparative mapping projects, and are essential for
microarray technology.
</dd>
<dt>Unigenes</dt>
<dd>SGN assembles and publishes unigene builds from these EST sequences.  For more information, see <a href="/methods/unigene/index.pl">Unigene Methods</a>.</dd>
<dt>Maps and Markers</dt>
<dd>SGN has genetic maps and a searchable catalog of markers for
tomato, potato, pepper, and eggplant.</dd>
<dt>Tomato Sequencing</dt>
<dd>SGN is the bioinformatics hub for the ongoing international project to
fully sequence the euchromatic portion of the tomato genome.  In this role,
we house:
  <ul style="margin-top: 0.5em">
    <li>a searchable catalog of tomato BACS</li>
    <li>more than 400,000 BAC end sequences from these BACs</li>
    <li>all BAC sequences used to assemble the tomato genome</li>
% if( my $g = $c->enabled_feature('gbrowse2') ) {
    <li>a <a href="<% $g->cgi_url.'/gbrowse' %>">Genome Browser</a> for sequence annotations</li>
% }
  </ul>
</dd>
<dt>Tools</dt>
<dd>SGN makes available a wide range of web-based bioinformatics tools
for use by anyone, listed <a href="/tools/">here</a>.  Some of our
most popular tools include <a href="/tools/blast/">BLAST</a> searches,
the <a href="/tools/solcyc/">SolCyc biochemical pathways database</a>,
a <a href="/tools/caps_designer/caps_input.pl">CAPS experiment
designer</a>, an innovative
<a href="/tools/intron_detection/find_introns.pl">Intron detection
tool</a>, an advanced <a href="/tools/align_viewer/">Alignment Analyzer</a> and <a href="/tools/tree_browser/">browser for phylogenetic trees</a>.   </dd>

<ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 1em">

   <li>We attempt to process all EST sequences
   directly from sequencing chromatograms using a custom
   pipeline developed at SGN. The sequences are assembled into unigenes
   using standard clustering software and in-house tools. A higher level of sequence
   quality is obtained when sequences are uniformly base-called and
   quality trimmed. Other software developed at SGN include the <a href="/cview/view_chromosome.pl">interactive comparative map viewer</a> for genetic and
   physical maps, the <a href="/tools/tree_browser/">Tree Browser</a> and the <a href="/tools/align_viewer">Alignment Analyzer</a>.</li>

<ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 1em">

   <li>We have developed simple web interfaces for the SGN user-community to submit, annotate, and curate the Solanaceae locus and phenotype databases. Our goal is to share biological information, and have the experts in their field
   review existing data and submit information about their favorite genes and phenotypes.</li>
