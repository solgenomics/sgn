  PLEASE READ BEFORE ACCESSING THE PRE-PUBLICATION TOMATO GENOME
  SEQUENCE: The International Tomato Genome Sequencing Consortium is
  pleased to make available a pre-publication draft assembly of the
  tomato genome for use by public and private research communities as
  a resource to enable plant biology discovery and improve the human
  condition through improved agriculture. This assembly was produced
  by the Dutch/French assembly team and includes both 454
  data and Sanger sequence data (BAC-ends, fosmid-ends and Selected
  BAC Mixture sequences).
  </p>

  <p>
  We caution you that the current assembly is a "work-in-progress" and
  as such is subject to modification prior to publication release
  (anticipated for mid-2010), some of which is likely to be
  substantial. Therefore we encourage you to carefully and
  independently validate any conclusions you may draw from this
  sequence. We will update this resource as improvements in the
  assembly are made. We welcome any feedback regarding your successes
  or that may assist us in improving the quality and accuracy of this
  sequence.
  </p>

  <p>
  The pre-publication tomato genome sequence is made available with
  the understanding that users will respect the rights of those who
  contributed to this effort to describe the tomato genome in a
  peer-reviewed publication. This description includes whole genome
  level analyses on genes, gene families, repetitive sequences etc. We
  encourage you to review the NIH-NHGRI guidelines on distribution and
  use of pre-publication genome sequence at
  <a href="http://www.genome.gov/page.cfm?pageID=10506537">http://www.genome.gov/page.cfm?pageID=10506537</a>.

  Any use of the tomato genome sequence prior to its publication should
  credit "The International Tomato Genome Sequencing Consortium". If
  you are uncertain about how to credit the use of the sequence or its
  appropriate use please do not hesitate to contact
